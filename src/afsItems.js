 */

// Provides the SVG code for coloured scenery and scene-piece items that are placed into the ant farm.
// Stores the SVG code with variable placeholders for common strings in the SVG code as a rudimentary form of data compression.
// - k is the image key corresponding to the item defined in afsData.js
// - bg is the hex string of the main paint color e.g. '#64BC41',
// - and fg is usually '#000' (or '#FFF'); the semi-transparent accent color.
let svgItems = (k, bg, fg) => {

	// When inserting SVGs here, perform these replacements on the SVG string so the data in the variable is as close to pure data as possible.
	// Replace any whitespace in the string with a single space first.
